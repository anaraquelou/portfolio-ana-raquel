													<h3>Identification of best properties for purchase and resale using a interactive map</h3>
													<p>Created interactive maps using the Python language to indicate opportunities to buy properties in Seattle. It was observed that having a view or waterfront, good condition, more floors and a recent renovation are characteristics that value real estate.  The strategy to buy houses below the average price of the region would bring approximately U$ 752 million in profit.</p>
													<h3>Tools used:</h3>
													<ul>
														<li>Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn</li>
														<li>Anaconda, Pycharm, Jupyter Notebook</li>
														<li>Interactive map with Plotly and Folium</li>

													<h3>Forecast of store sales in the next 6 weeks through a regression model</h3>
													<p>Building a Machine Learning algorithm to predict sales of the next six weeks of 1115 stores of a pharmaceutical company in Europe. The decision tree-based Regression algorithm was trained and after validation, presented 10% error (MAPE). The estimate is that the solution, if implemented, would bring U$ 5 million in monthly revenue growth to the company.</p>

													<h3>Ranking system to improve cross-selling in a insurance company using a classification model</h3>
													<p>A recomendation system was build to identify clients more likely to buy a second product using a classification model. Since the commercial team has limited resources it was calculated the best k number o clients to reach to otimized profit. The final model presented 91.62% recall at k equal to 40,254 bringing a total profit of U$ 4.24 million.</p>
